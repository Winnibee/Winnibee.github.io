    No one told me I was going to be her lawyer in the case. Luckily my teacher had prepared me for a court appearance. It was an ordeal for me to climb onto the tall chairs though. And i had to go to the bathroom. There was't a bathroom in the building so I walked to the zoo next door. The only available bathroom there had to be crawled into, and i wasn't sure I'd make it back out. Especially since the alligator, panther, tiger and lion had escaped. They were't full sized, but they still liked to follow me aroud looking for pets. I was scared they'd turn at any moment. It was part gym, part library too, so one of the ladies working out called the librarian who hadn't yet made it in for the day.
