I'd always imagined I'd start at post zero, or entry zero, or day zero or blog zero too, I guess. I don't know what's so special about starting at a number that's less than one. But there's definitely something there. Something intrriguing to it.<br><br>
It's likely my style of writing and voice is going to change quite a bit throughout my blogging adventure. Though it's much more likely that I just won't continue this adventure at all, and there will only be a couple of posts here, that will wither into nothingness and as good as fall out of existance. But maybe I'll have learned some coding out of it, and I'm seeming to enjoy it, so that's probably something.<br><br>
It's also equally as likely as the last two statements, if not more so, that no one will ever read these entries. And I'm okay with that. Part of me would more prefer it really. It's not always a pleasant feeling to present part of yourself to someone else, especially when the vastness of yourself exists only in your head. It's very likely my expressions will be greatly different than the me I've been able to present to people outwardly, with that lovely sheen of awkardness that cloaks everything I do.<br><br>
I have been breaking away at it slowly.  Part of the problem was that I never tried before. People just weren't something I cared about. They weren't complex, and they weren't interesting. Only those who were absolutely unreachable may have intrigued me. I only recently considered how to make friends. Within the past 5 years of my life probably. I had friends from growing up of course. Friends of convinience, who were around, but who were no less valuable for it. They were mostly friends of relations, but they still accepted me, when I wasn't there, when I was numb. They still managed to have fond memories of me and still consider me to be close, as I do them. I appreciate them much more now than I did then. <br><br>
And then one day, I started living, the way I always wanted to, but it was somewhere burried deep down. I'm not everything I want to be. Not yet. But I'm more than I ever was. The catalyst to my channge was the same as most peoples' would have been, I think. Though my developement came to me later in life than most people. I was 22 when I had the major break-up that woke up my life. I'd been in that relationship for 8 years, since I was 14, and it wasn't until it was over could I look at all the things I kept from myself about it. All that I missed out on. All the bad I did. All the lies I told them and myself. I wasn't there for most of that relationship, but I'd never have admitted it. I stopped being part of that relationship years before it ended, though at the same time, I was what was keeping it together. I couldn't admit it. I put the relationship before everything, myself, my family, my work, it didn't matter.<br><br>
I would love to be able to say I woke up one day and came to my senses, that I ended it and took control myself. I took my life back. But that's just not true. I was weak. I was left. And it was my fault. And it was their fault. And it needed so bad to happen, so that we could both live, actually live, and enjoy life, and behave in the way we wanted.<br><br>
It wasn't until after that I realized I didn't really want to be offended at everything, pissed at everyone. It was a weird thing to realize. Living with a for-myself mentality, as I had been, started disgusting me after that. It's easy to see things in retrospect, but still coping with the fact that your a horrible person can be difficult. I had kept a lot of it with internal judgement, so not everyone had knew what I was, somehow. People were sweet, especially those friends who stayed by me, they knew there was good here, even if I'd never showed them before. I had friends, who I never fully appreciated before I needed them. It was ugly of me, but I wasn't going to make that mistake again.<br><br>
Bill was first, along with other life-longers. Me and Bill were always together, even before we were, we did most things together. My ex never wanted to leave, so he'd send Bill to come with me instead. When we got together, people said it should have been obvious, but I'm not sold. I'm not sure it would have worked sooner or later. All I know is that now was right. And remains to be. <br><br>
