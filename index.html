<h6 class="subentry">Not really a post but similar to an <i>about the author</i> section you'd find in a book. So the date posted is irrelevant.</h6>
        
<p class="entry">Winnibee is a human, who lives in a very hot and humid part of their country. Winnibee's fuzzy companions are two sweet fuzzy kittens; Crookshanks and Salem. Winnibee's human companion is a Bill. Winnibee and Bill do in fact have good times together, even adventures occasionally. They read together and watch shows, and they're currently trying to find more things that interest them on a deeper level, something to make good careers of. Writing is a wonderful consideration, when you notice how many books they own. Coding is also very high ranked, when you notice how many video games they partake in. When Winnibee misses home, pictures of these companions are often observed and help bring happiness.</P>
